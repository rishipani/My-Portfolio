This is my portfolio website. 
Yes, I built it. 
No, I didn’t use some drag-and-drop nonsense — this is handcrafted with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript because apparently that’s the developer starter pack now. 
I use npm like a normal human being, not pnpm or yarn or whatever package manager is trending this week. 
It has a layout, some components I probably won’t reuse, and dark mode because we fear light. 

Want to run it? 
1. Clone it.
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

and pretend you're impressed. 

The project structure is decent if you squint, and everything kind of works unless you look too closely. 
This README only exists so I can say “yes, I documented my code” without actually doing it. 

You're not supposed to read this far anyway — just hire me already.
